FASCINATING SPAGHETTI FACTS

=== ORIGIN & HISTORY ===

• The word "spaghetti" comes from the Italian word "spaghetto," meaning "little cord" or "thin string" (diminutive of "spago" meaning twine)

• Spaghetti was likely introduced to Sicily by Arab conquerors in the 8th century. The Arab meal was called "itriyya" (meaning "thin focaccia cut into strips")

• The name "spaghetti" was first officially recorded in 1874, suggesting it remained a regional dish until after Italy's unification
